# Introduction

HunspellVBA is a library to access Hunspell functionality from VBA. Although the name includes VBA it can be used in other Windows-based DLL accessing environments.

Please note that bitness of hunspell and HunspellVBA must match to work.

This library is used in [Katip](https://github.com/berkesas/Katip4/) project.

# Limitations

Only basic functions of Hunspell are converted. In future all functions will be transferred based on the use needs.
